# Bookstore
My College project developed using Java Spring-Boot
To use this application first install Apache Tomcat server, this application was created on server 9.
Since the project uses Maven all the dependencies will be added by it.
Download the adminportal from the git repository to add new books, it is also necessary to display 
relevant information about books on the store page.
